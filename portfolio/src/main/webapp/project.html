      <h3>Internship</h3>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
        I had an internship program in the year 2017. It lasted 6 weeks. 
        I was an intern at Outreach Women and Children's Hospital located 
        in FESTAC town Lagos State, Nigeria. I shadowed the nurses for three 
        weeks and then the doctors for the remaining three weeks. On my first 
        day, I was given a tour and shown how the hospital works. 
        I worked in the pre-natal and natal unit for a while. I learnt 
        how to use the blood pressure machine, the syringe pump, heart 
        monitors and incubators. I learnt the term triage and how it is 
        applied in their hospital procedure. Triage the assignment of 
        degrees of urgency to wounds or illnesses to decide the order of 
        treatment of a large number of patients or casualties. I also learnt 
        how to check the basic vitals of a patient. 
        I helped the nurses arrange the consultation rooms, carry out 
        triage and check vitals of patients. I also helped by preparing 
        drugs for injections. I made runs to the pharmacy and I also carried 
        samples and specimen to the laboratory to be tested. I also worked 
        in the pathology department of the hospital. Working in the 
        hospital was very educative and fun too. I made me more happy 
        about my career choice and made more driven too do more.

      <h3>Research Experience</h3>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
       I am part of a cancer biology lab at Fisk University which is 
       currently researching Melanoma Antigen Gene (MAGE) proteins 
       focusing on MAGE As and Bs. The study is focused on the MAGEâ€™s, 
       their expression in cancer cells and their functions in the body. 
       The purpose of this study is to find out if the expression of the 
       MAGEs can be controlled to prevent or cure cancer. We use PCR, 
       western blots, etc. to collect our data. I study scientific 
       literature about the MAGE protein family to improve the 
       understanding of their functions under normal conditions, and its 
       role in the propagation of cancer.
