      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p  style="text-align:left;">
        I am a citizen of Nigeria born in Onitsha Anambra state although 
        I hail from Ukpo Dunukofia local government area Anambra state, 
        Nigeria. I come from a close-knit family of seven. I was born to 
        Sir Godwin Okeke and Lady Lynda Okeke on the 18th of July 2001. 
        I am the eldest child of five children. I have two brothers and 
        two sisters. I attended Our Lords Shepherd International School 
        for my primary education, it is located in Enugu state Nigeria. 
        Then Mea Mater Elizabeth High School for my secondary education 
        which is also located in Enugu state Nigeria. We currently 
        live in Lagos state in Nigeria. My mother is a cooperate lawyer 
        and my father is a business man (focusing on pharmaceuticals). 
        <br> <br> 
        I am currently attending Fisk University, located in Nashville TN. 
        Fisk University is a small private historically black university 
        located in north Nashville, Tennessee. It was established in the 
        year 1866. I am a full-time sophomore at Fisk.  I am a biochemistry 
        and molecular biology major in the pre-med pathway and also a data 
        science minor.  My specialization is going to be in pediatric surgery. 
        Pediatric surgeons operate on children whose development ranges from 
        the newborn stage through the teenage years. I have always loved 
        children and working with them, caring for them and loving them is 
        my favorite thing to do. Picking a career that has to do with taking 
        care of little children just came naturally to me. I also have a 
        love for computer science. I discovered my love for it in the 10th 
        grade. My teacher introduced the program development life cycle and 
        I was hooked. My love for computer science has not wavered despite 
        being a biochemistry major. I believe being a biochemistry major 
        gives me a unique perspective to tackling coding problems.
        <br><br>
        I have a lot of interests and some of them include travelling,
        reading, fashion, makeup, baking, cooking, cycling, and swimming. I love 
        afrobeats music and hip-pop. My favourite series is game of thrones
        and my favourite book is Half of a yellow sun by Chimamanda Ngozi 
        Adichie. I love debating and I an part of the W.E.B. Dubois Honors
        debate team at Fisk University.
